 10 Fingers ,"Great game for getting to know each other in a new group.  All players in a circle, holding all 10 fingers up in the air.  One person at a time, start asking personal questions that take yes-no answers; whoever cannot answer yes to a question, drops a finger.  Last person with a finger left wins. Good questions are things like ""I have a cat"", ""I have never stolen anything"" and so on.												"," Icebreakers

 3 Lines ," Description A great exercise to train scene start-ups. 2 players initiate a scene; the scene is broken off after 3 lines.  The goal is to establish as much as possible as fast as possible.  We want to understand the  Platform, the  Characters , the  Environment and the points of view or drivers of the characters. Once 3 lines of dialog have been uttered, restart a different scene.
