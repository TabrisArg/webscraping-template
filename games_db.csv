 3 Series ," Description Everyone in a circle.  Pick a category (e.g. make of cars, girls names, kinds of food, kinds of plants, whatever).  First person states an example of the category, and points to someone else.  Keep pointing.  That someone else does the same, with a different item in the category, and so forth, until everyone points at one person. Then repeat the pattern.  Make eye contact when passing your item to thenext person.  Drop the pointing arms when everyone is comfortable and the seriesis collectively memorized. Then do the same with a second category, and make sure the pointing patternis different.  Repeat till everyone is comfortable. Then do the same exercise, without pointing, and running the 2 categories at the same time.  Add a third, fourth category if you wish.  No pointing arms any more! The idea is not only to listen for the item right before yours in the series (so you know when it`s your turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you.  If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken.

 Blind Lead ," Description One player is blindfolded, and the room is filled with obstacles (put a couple of chairs everywhere, leave all kinds of junk on the floor).  The idea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player throughthe room, by talking.  Also known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name `Airplane`: The blindfoldee (or just eyesclosed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors.He is an ""Airplane"" lost in the fog being talked down by the ""Air TrafficController"", who must remain in his/her ""Tower"". Standing on achair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplanealso only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) toreach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowedtwo ""brushes""-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or adirect hit or stepping on something directly causes a ""crash"". They maystep around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only flyforward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must begiven from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledglingdirectors. You can also destroy all the trust you`ve built up in yourclass by completely clearing the deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us,someone will suggest it.Also known as Obstacle Course.

 Excluding ,"4 players play a scene, in which one of the players gets excluded.   Notes This is a group exercise, in the sense that players should be sensing where the majority of the group is going (see  Alien Tiger Cow ).Tell players not to be afraid of `being nasty` - be extreme in your exclusion (that makes it easier, also for theplayer that is excluded - see  Mr. Nice Guy ).  Whoever gets excluded should gladly accept this and react accordingly.Excluded players can go to extremes to be re-included - hilariously funny if even this is thoroughly ignored by the others. Variations Let the exclusion evolve; allow a player that got excluded to get 2 others to join him and exclude the fourth one.  This only works if the excluded player first allows herself to be excluded (a little  Chivalry here). Also known as Alliances. . This game was originally created as a pattern game for long form shows at the Theatresports London Impro Lab in the late 1980`s.  The whole point of the game is NOT to actively try and exclude anyone.  The exclusion of one player should happen as a result of the other players making alliances with one another.  If you don`t do this the scene doesn`t form very good patterns and the players get too competitive.   You also miss the slow, sliding status drops and the desperate attempts to hook into an existing alliance, that happen when a player is starting to nrealize that they are being excluded.A good way to start this game would be: Start in a black-out seated round a table While the lights are still down the entire ensemble starts to laugh (as if someone has just told the punchline to a hilarious joke) The lights slowly fade up as the cast`s laughter winds down and the alliances begin to form By the end of the scene, which climaxes in a final, dramatic exclusion, we usually end up with four to six threads and a clear protagonist  Big thanks to  Alan MarriottofCrunchy Frog Collective and Grand Theft Impro(London, England) for the additional info on Alliances.

The audience needs to reply to the interview in one voice (all saying the same at the same time - see  One Mouth ). Not an easy one, and if the audience does not feel like doing this it really sucks. When it works it`s a real thrill. divide the audience in 3 or 4 groups, and give each group a sound. Rehearse the sound with each group. Then tell a silly story, and use these sounds as sound effects. (We saw a pretty gruesome one in which one group was a car (roar), another a dog (bark) and the third group got a kind of splashing sound. The poor dog got run over by the car... not exactly nice but the audience had fun with it) Do a cheering competition between the men and the women. Rehearse different kinds of applause (from the `polite` applause when a scene sucks, over an `ooh` applause for a touching scene, to a wild roar for a hilarious scene). Have them rehearse voting for a team by cheering the team name (if that`s your format). Rehearse a `Die` ( see  Die ) if iyou`re going to be playing scenes in which the audience can decide to throw a player out of the game. Give the men and the women a different sound and play with that.

 Bippety Bop(1) ," Description Silly warm-up to get the blood flowing.  A players in a circle, one player in the middle.   The player in the middle closes his eyes, holds right hand pointing in front of him, and spins around.  When done spinning, open your eyes and say, as fast as you can `Bippety Bippety Bop`.The player you`re pointing to, and his 2 neighbors, need to build an elephantin less than the time the middle player needs to say `Bippety Bippety Bop`.  An elephant consists of a trunk, made by the middle player, by holding your nose with one hand, and extending your other arm through the arm that holds the hand that holds the nose (does this make any sense?).  The neighboring players each form a big ear, using both arms.  Don`t forget to attach the ears to the elephant`s head. Any player that cannot get his/her part done by the time the middle playerdoes `Bippety Bippety Bop` becomes `it` and takes place in the middle of the circle. Variations You can really invent any object or create to replace the elephant. Try a car, with 2 wheels and a set of wind screen wipers a cow, with an udder and 2 horns a washing machine, with 2 players building a `box` with both arms, and the middle player waving her arms in a circle in front of her.

 BarPro ,"The (slightly negative sounding) name is attributed to  Keith Johnstone and refers to shows consisting of short games, played in small rooms, like bars and tiny comedy clubs. In this simple format, a limited number of players (4-6) play improv games, introduced, and usually directed by an MC. In certain troupes the players take turns MC-ing and/or directing.There are usually no judges, no score boards and no prizes to be won. Suggestions are taken from the audience, drawn out of a hat or provided by the MC. Due to the lack of space, there are usually no props or attributes, except for perhaps a coat hanger with clothes and a couple of hats; players typically mime their props.As far as we know the name BarPro is not copyrighted."," Format

 String of Pearls ,"In this improv game, players tell a story out of order, once sentence at a time.  One player steps forward and makes up the first line of the story.  This player takes place to the utmost left of the scene. A second player steps forward and makes up a last line that has absolutely nothing to do with the first. Take utmost right of the scene.The rest of the players each fill in a line of the story wherever they can, trying to bring things together and end up with a story that makes complete sense. Every time a new line is added, the players go down the string and repeat their lines first to last. This game works best with 7 or 8 players.  Players ideally fill up spots in the 'line' randomly, i.e. they contribute new sentences at random points in the story. As a suggestion you can either ask for a title, a genre, or even first line and last line.  Or ask for no suggestion at all. If you have say over 6 players, it is ideal that the 3rd line that is added it tack in the middle, and very unrelated to both first and last line.   Resist the temptation to fill the spots linearly (from left to right).Also known as Story String.  Also known as Beads on a String. 												"," Narration

 Rendez-vous ," Description The  Backstory for this  Long Form handle is as follows: We have an Evil Character.  The audience gets to choose who plays this character. The Evil Character will instruct 3-5 other characters to be at a specific (abandonded) place at a specific time.  There is no reason provided.  Audience get to choose which players play the 'invited' characters (the guests). Audience also gets to choose the location.  Good example is e.g. an abandoned factory on an island.  Location that have many rooms are ideal. The performance consists of 2 parts.  First part is 3-5 scenes in which each character is introduced.  In the scene, the Evil Character invites the guest.  There should be good reasons why the guests accept the invitation, based on whatever information was provided in the scene prior to the arrival of the Evil Character. Second part is where all guests have the rendez-vous in the chosen location.  They do not know each other; there is probably confusion.  When all guests have arrived, the Evil Character explains that be the end of the night, all guests but one will die. The guests then try and figure out why they are there, and perhaps evade their deaths. Supporting actors may play other characters the live ot, or haunt the location. It should be important that the characters cannot (easily) leave the location.  ( Also known as Behind closed doors. ). Performance ends either when only one guest remains alive and is set free by the Evil Character, or when the guests find out why they are there and are 'forgiven' by the Evil Character.  Or, alternatively, they might kill/capture the Evil Character and escape. Notes The Evil Character may turn out not to be the puppet master.  Perhaps he is just the messenger for an Even More Evil Character who reveals himself in the second part.												"," Characters

Standing on achair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplanealso only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) toreach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowedtwo ""brushes""-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or adirect hit or stepping on something directly causes a ""crash"". They maystep around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only flyforward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must begiven from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledglingdirectors.

Evidently, players don`t know their own status, so the other players will have to endow them. Notes Set up a location where status is important.  Examples would be a Royal Palace or a highly organizedbureaucracy (the White House ?). Variations  players can only see their own card, but not the others` give players multiple cards, and let them switch cards in the middle of the scene.  Statuses (statii ??) should change accordingly. as an exercise, let players play a scene and then ask them to line upin status order to see if they `got` their status right."," Endowment

 CD Shop ,"This is a variation on  Greatest Hits , for those over 30 (those under 30 never bought CDs in a physical shop, we fear).  Setting is a CD shop, one player is the sales person, the other is a client.  Audience suggestion is someone to buy a present for, or an occasion to buy a present.  Say ""graduating medical school"".  The buyer is looking for an appropriate CD to buy for this person/occasion. The seller presents several CDs, each CD gets an explicit style/artist, and the seller offers to demo an appropriate song. E.g. for the graduation, ""How about a Lady Gaga album?  Her new album  is called ""Doctor Love"" and it has this great song ""Measles"".  One or more other players (and preferably a musician) then perform the song. After 3-4 songs the buyer agrees to buy the album and scene ends.												"," Performance

 LCD ," Description This improv game is called Location, Career, Death (LCD). One player on stage, the others off stage.  The audience provides a location, an occupation and an object, only known to the player on stage.  Second player enters and a scene is played in gibberish.  Player one needs to communicate the location to player 2; as soon as player 2 thinks he`s got it, her claps his hands and spins around.  Then player 2 needs to guess the occupation; clap and spin when you thinkyou got it.  Finally, the object needs to be revealed.  As soon as player 2 has theobject, he needs to kill player 1 with it. Then the next player comes on stage and the game recommences, until all playershave played.  Afterwards, line up the players and ask them where they think theywere, what their occupation was and what the murder weapon was - usually quite faroff the original suggestion, much to the audience`s amusement.Also known as LOW. (Location, Occupation, Weapon).  Also known as Chain Murder. See also  Hijacker for a similar game without the  Gibberish component. Variations Use a bell, every 10 seconds or so; at the bell players need to clap and spinand proceed to the next step, even if they are not sure about the where, who and what.

Ask the players to find some sort of inspiration, and then they should use that to change their walk. Anything can be used as inspiration: use an emotion (happy!), an occupation (farmer!), a stereotype (Irish!), an animal (Snake!) or even an object (grandfather clock!).  Next, turn the way you are walking into a character.

 Chivalrous Couples ,"One person with a loud voice will stand on a chair or other high place so that they can be seen above the heads of the group. After you have explained the game and everyone is ready the person on the chair will call out one of the following couples: Knight and Queen, Prince and Princess, and Horse and Rider. When one of these three couples is called people must get into pairs. If Horse and Rider were called one of the people in the pairs will be the Horse and one will be the Rider. Then the pairs will get into the correct formation.Each of the three chivalrous couples has its own formation that goes with it. The Knight and Queen's formation is one person as the ""Knight"" down on one knee and the other person as the ""Queen"" sitting on the ""Knight's"" knee. The Prince and Princess formation is one person as the ""Prince"" will have the the other person, the ""Princess,"" in their arms. The Horse and Rider formation is the ""Horse"" will be standing up and the ""Rider"" will be riding piggy-back on the ""Horse.""The last pair to get into the correct formation is either out of the game or they ""Take 5"" off to the side of the group. After one chivalrous couple has been called and one or two pairs of people have been eliminated have the group mingle. Then randomly call another couple. Have the group try to get into pairs with different people at every round. 												"," Energy

Here`s how to do the rhythm: each beat consists of 4 phases: Slap both hands on your thighs Clap your hands Snap your left hand fingers Snap your right hand fingersWith every right hand snap, a word should be thrown to your neighbor.  Once the rhythm is established, you can leave out the snaps - that`ll make things more understandable. Variations You can use this for both  Last Letter games or  Free Association Circle . Try this with two circles. Have one circle associate freely, and anothercircle on  Last Letter .

 Click Bang you`re dead ," Description Description: all players sit in a circle.  Only one player should know how to play and what the secret is; this player is the leader at first, until others catch on.  This person points at random people in the circle each time saying either ""click"" or ""bang""; they should make it sound and look like what they are doing has to do with math or the order they are going etc.The secret: it really doesn't matter who is pointed to, what is said, when they are pointed to, who it begins with or who it ends with, it just depends on who speaks first after the clicks and bangs are done.  So the person who begins (the one that knows what's going on) will declare whoever talks first dead by saying ""you're dead"".  That person isn't ""out"" or anything, it's just for effect.  The game continues until the players catch on.  If somebody thinks they get it, the leader gives them a chance to say the clicks and bangs and they get to announce who is dead; the leader will then be able to tell if they understand the secret if they announce the right person as being dead.Make sure that once the players begin to catch on, they don't spoil it for the others by letting the cat out of the bag.  Also, the game is best if played with ten or more people. Contributed by Jeannie Smith from Hawai. Thanks for that Jeannie! 												"," Concentration

 Cloud Atlas ," Description Cloud Atlas is a book by author David Mitchell, which has a peculiar structure.  The same structure can be used to create a Long Form improv show.  For details on the book (spoiler alert) see  the book's wikipedia page. Here is how the format works: it is a long form show with an intermission.  Before the break, a number of stories (6 stories in the original book, but any number above 2 will work) are half told; these stories take place in history, time running forward, and each story is played in a particular, different style.  After the break, the stories are finished, one after the other, but in inverse order.  By the end of the show, the stories should have connections between them.  An example to clarify.  Ask 4 suggestions of historical periods & locations, in historical order.  The (near & far) future are allowed.  Suppose we get: french revolution, first world war Britain, today (2013-ish) USA and 2030 China.  This will lead to 4 story lines, and 8 parts, 4 before the break and 4 after.  Each story line is played as a  Straight Story .  For example: Story 1/part 1: Dramatic story in france during revolution Story 2/part 1: Love story during WW1 Story 3/part 1: Thriller in USA, current time Story 4/part 1: Musical in post-communist China Break Second half of story 4 Second part of story 3 Second half of story 2 Second part of story 1 There should be a link from story 1 to story 2, one from story 2 to story 3 and one from story 3 to story 4.  All the links should be different in kind and not be purely thematic, e.g. a book written by a character in story 1 may be important in story 2; an invention done in story 2 may be linked to a character's profession in story 3 and so forth.   If one link is a character the other links should not be characters.  Ideally, not all links are established before the break.  For a really concrete example see the wikipedia link on the plots in Mitchell's book. Origin Original book by David Mitchell, 2004.  Idea of using the structure for a long form is attributed to Tom Tollenaere.												"," Long Form
